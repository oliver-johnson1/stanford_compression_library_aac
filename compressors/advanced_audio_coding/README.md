<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is an audio coding standard for lossy audio compression that is used for storage and transmission of digital audio. It exploits the limitations of human hearing to reduce information in parts of the signal that are less perceivable. It is the successor to the MP3 format, and has especially better audio quality in the 32-80 bitrate range. It is used as the default media format by YouTube, iPhone, iPod, iPad, Apple iTunes, and several other platforms. As part of this project we implemented a version of AAC in Python that retains many of the key attributes, but is also simple enough to understand, and also prototyped different parameters and blocks.
